              <h1>ABOUT THE VOLTA FASHION AWARDS</h1>
              <p class="text">
                Volta fashion awards is an awards set to appreciate, celebrate and promote fashion designers,
                fashion brands, fashion personalities and other individuals in the fashion industry in the Volta
                Region. The award comes with categories that will discover fashion industry players in every part of Volta region and
                give them a sensitive platform to sprint to the national level. The awards come with contracts and plaques to various
                winners from each category.
                th The maiden edition was held on 19 October, 2019 at the Ho Technical University JCR and it was such a great event.
                The organizers of this event want to sustain it as they want it to be a yearly event to help promote the fashion industry in
                the Volta Region. Due to this, work towards the 2020 edition begun early 2020 but had to be called off due to the Corona

        <h1>PURPOSE</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this awards is to celebrate everyone from the Volta region who have been
          Impacting positively in the fashion industry either nationally or regionally. The most important factor is that, the person
          is from the region because is of no doubt that most top industry players at the national level are from the Volta region but
          they are being shadowed by their place of settlement which is Greater Accra region. The award is also to recognize and
          unveil hidden industry players that have been working hard over the past years. Basically, when we talk of fashion in
          Ghana and in the region, is limited to only fashion designers. The awards is set to educate the public about what the
          industry entails which is part of the activities and pre-events before the show and this will be a major contribution to the
          development of the fashion industry in the region.</p>
